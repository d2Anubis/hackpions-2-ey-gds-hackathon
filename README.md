# EY GDS Hackpions 2.0 - Hackathon

**NLP-based tagging solution**

**Overview**

The Intelligent Automation team manually processes a large volume of exception data. The manual process includes examining the exception reasons and categorizing them broadly into business or technical issues, which is time consuming and increases turnaround time. 

You need to build an intelligent solution, to auto label exceptions as they occur.

**Deliverables**

Propose and design a machine learning algorithm, that will carry out the following tasks:

- Use training data and keywords across categories, for each of the exceptions, as given below:
- Create an input excel file, with a list of exceptions.
- Business exception
- System exception
- Other
- Generate an output text file, with the respective exception tags.
- Create a self-learning model to recognize patterns, determine correlation with other input data set features, learn from data and tag exceptions as they come.

**Submission**

An AI assistant that identifies exceptions in real time.
